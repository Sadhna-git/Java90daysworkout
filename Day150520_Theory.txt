1.Why String is immutable?
String objects are immutable which means unchangeable or unmodifiable.
Once string object is created its data or state cannot be changed but a new string object is created

2.How can you check if a String is immutable?
Consider a String :-
String name = Coffee;
name.concat(shop);//This will append "shop" with "Cofee"
System.out.println(name);
This will print only Coffee because strings are immutable objects 
  
But by explicitely assigning it to the reference variable as below, we can make the strin mutable
String newname = name.concat(shop);
System.out.println(name);
This will print Coffeeshop

3.Why String literal is faster than objects 
string object will always take more time to execute than string literal because it will construct a new string every time it is executed.

4.What will happen if you concatenate a String with another 
Concatenation is the process of appending one string to the end of another string. You concatenate strings by using the + operator.
